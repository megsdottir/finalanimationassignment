Flowers have always had a sentimental meaning to me.
I was born and raised in Japan, a country in which each spring the cherry blossoms bloom and every city is lit up in a vibrant pink.

I was raised by my grandmother, who loved to plant flowers on her balcony, and every spring she would plant a new flower for me. 

As a result, I have always tried to incorporate flowers into any work I do. 

It took a lot of brainstorming to figure out how I would achieve my goal of creating flowers in OpenFrameworks, but I managed to come up with an idea
that I think turned out nicely.

I wanted to create a flower that would slowly blossom. In order to get the "blossoming" effect, I used a loop. 
I aligned the loop to start in the center of the screen and drew three ellipses each in different colors so that they would slowly rotate from 
the center of the screen and create a floral effect. 

I like to work with pastel colors, hence the light shades of orange, purple and pink that I used. In order to make the colors of the flowers pop, 
I made the background a light blue color.

As the ellipses rotate, it starts to create flowers in different shapes.

I think it would be fun to add more to this by creating more flowers in different sections of the screens and though I spent many hours trying to make 
that work, I was unable to successfully run the app. However it is something I am still working on and will hopefully be able to create! 

I'm quite proud of myself for this one because it really pushed me to use all of the knowledge I've gained over these past few weeks :)
